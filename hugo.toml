I occupy the small intersection of people who love writing code and people who think running really, really, long miles is actually fun üèÉ‚Äç‚û°Ô∏è

{{< new_line >}}
I'm based in the midwest as a lead software developer pushing out code for the often ignored but quite interesting bond markets (no, not jail bonds, think treasuries and munis). When I get some time away from the compiler I will likely be out for a run on the Ice Age trail

{{< new_line >}}
In addition to race reports and training updates, I enjoy writing about Go. C#, JavaScript and SQL are my day-to-day so I have a lot to say about those. You'll see me writing about  AI dev tooling and machine learning in financial services as I work these tools
