## AI Literacy

I’ve heard the phrase “AI literacy” a few times recently, so it must be a thing now. I’ll be writing up some of the ways I have started using AI in both life and work as a software developer to highlight my literacy.

I’ve been leaning into AI at work and in daily life the last 2 months. By leaning in, I mean I start with AI for any task that generally requires a computer (except writing this of course). It wasn’t until I the end of 2024 that I started using AI as more than a novelty toy and more as a regular tool. 

A big part of my increased use of AI is hearing how other people are using it. ”Vibe coding” apps, learning new concepts, generating test datasets, asking questions you might be afraid to ask (imposter syndrome), or helping you make a plan. I’m putting my prompts out there for others to see.
